# GitHub User Search App

A responsive GitHub profile search app built as a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6).

## Features

- Search any GitHub user by username and display their profile data via the GitHub REST API
- Automatically respects system color scheme preference with a manual light/dark mode toggle

## Key Learnings

- **TypeScript basics** — first TS project, covering interface definitions, type annotations, and working with typed API responses
- **SVGR** — using the SVGR plugin to import SVG files as React components
- **REST API** — fetching and handling data from the GitHub API including loading and error states
- **CSS architecture** — building a structured `index.css` with Tailwind v4, using semantic color tokens to manage light and dark mode from a single source of truth
